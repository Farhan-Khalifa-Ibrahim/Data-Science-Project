# Data-Science-Project
In this project I am trying to explore What's cooking data from kaggle to predict cuisine based on its ingredients.
I also make some data visualization to learn more about the data. In this project I use plotly for my data visualization. You should download Pyplot for anaconda
I use anaconda as my Ipython to make this project. You can download anaconda in https://www.anaconda.com/ and open it in jupyter notebook.
